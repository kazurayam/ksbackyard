Katalon Studio Backyard developed by kazurayam
=======================

This project is a [Katalon Studio]() project where I develop a few Custom Keywords to share with other Katalon Studio projects. The custom keywords belongs to
the Groovy package name `com.kazurayam.ksbackyard`.


Groovy classes includes:
- `com.kazurayam.ksbackyard.Assert` --- Synonym to `org.junit.Assert` but reports to Katalon Studio's Logging system.
- `com.kazurayam.ksbackyard.ImageCollectionDiffer` --- A bridge between aShot and Materials.
- `com.kazurayam.ksbackyard.ScreenshotDriver` --- A wrapper class of aShot, plus ImageDifference class
- `com.kazurayam.ksbackyard.URLParser`
- `com.kazurayam.ksbackyard.YouTubeVideoVerifier`
